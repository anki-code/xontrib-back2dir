## Installation

To install use pip:

```bash
xpip install xontrib-back2dir
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/anki-code/xontrib-back2dir
echo "xontrib load back2dir" > ~/.xonshrc
```

## Usage

No additional actions needed. The xontrib just saves the latest directory and uses it when
xonsh starts:

```bash
bash   ~     $ xonsh
xonsh  ~     $ cd /etc
xonsh  /etc  $ exit     # the latest directory is /etc

bash   ~     $ xonsh
xonsh  /etc  $ # the latest directory
```

If you run xonsh not from the `$HOME` directory the latest directory will be ignored:

```bash
bash   ~     $ cd /tmp
bash   /tmp  $ xonsh
xonsh  /tmp  $ # latest directory ignored
```
